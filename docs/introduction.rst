Introduction

You are reading the documentation for Lattice Dynamics, a python based code 
wrapper for performing the harmonic (HA) and quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA).
The code is currently set-up to work with Tinker Molecular Modeling (with minor
tweaks to their code), CP2K, and Quantum Espresso. The code is built to wrap around
any simulation suit that can perform:

* Geometry optimizations
* Mass-weighted Hessian computations
* Potential energy computations


This code was created by Nathan Abraham and Professor Michael Shirts at the 
University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Chemical & Biological 
Engineering. Any questions regarding code use can be directed to 
nate.abraham@colorado.edu. 

Set-up
------
We suggest downloading the latest release (.zip or .tar.gz), which can be found on 
GitHub under the 'release' tab. 

In addition to our code you will need to install any simulation package that you wish
to work in conjunction with.

Our code also requires installation of the python package 
`munkres <http://software.clapper.org/munkres/>`_.
